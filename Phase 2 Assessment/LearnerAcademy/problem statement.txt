	● Set up a master list of all the teachers
	● Set up a master list of all the classes
	● Assign classes for subjects from the master list

	● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
     

There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers
